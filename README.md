# Project Requests

Build Canada is making Canada the most prosperous country on earth. 

To do that, we need to build, connect Canadian builders and hold our governments accountable to building this country.

These are projects we want to see built in service of Canada, come build them with us!

## Project Requests

### [Canada Spends](https://github.com/BuildCanada/CanadaSpends)

It's hard to understand how our governments spends our money. Canada Spends tries to make spending data more accesible. 

### [Government Outcomes Tracker](https://github.com/BuildCanada/OutcomesTracker)

The government promises to do a lot of things, let's use AI to keep it accountable for what it is doing (or failing ot do).
